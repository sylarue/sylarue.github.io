<p>
        <h2><b> What to eat</b> </h2>
<ul><h3></p>
<p>
  <li>  <b> Pastel de nata</b> - Test the classic at <a href="http://pasteisdebelem.pt/en/" target="_blank">Pasteis de Belem</a> during your day seeing Belem Tower.
    Next, stop by the more conveniently located <a href="https://www.timeoutmarket.com/lisboa/en/eat-and-drink/manteigaria-fabrica-de-pasteis-de-nata/" target="_blank">Manteigaria </a> where you can get them fresh out of the oven.</li>
</p></li>
<p>
  <li> <b> Steak at <a href="https://www.timeoutmarket.com/lisboa/comer-e-beber/cafe-de-sao-bento/" target="_blank">Cafe S Bento </a> </b> - Although Cafe S Bento has their own independent locations, I'd recommend checking out their outpost in the Time Out Market.  The quality is exactly the same (amazing!) and you can also sample other vendors at the market to round out your dinner. </li>
</p>
<p>
  <li><b>Any meal at <a href="http://www.minibar.pt/en/" target="_blank"> Mini Bar</a> </b>- Tapas done right by local celebrity chef, Jose Avillez. Every course will be incredible, but make sure you order the mini cocktails to bite, tempura avocado and vietnamese pork sandwich.
    A must do in Lisbon, <i>call now to make reservations!  </i> </li>
</p></li>
<p>
  <li><b> Dinner at <a href="https://www.timeout.com/lisbon/restaurants/a-taberna-da-rua-das-flores" target="_blank">Taberna Rua de Las Flores </a> </b>- The soft shell crab was unbelievable. Be sure to stop by very early in the evening to put your name in since the restaurant is small and fills up for the entire evening by 7-8p.
</h3></li>
</p></ul>

<h2><b> What to see</b> </h2>
<ul><h3>
<p>
<li> <b> Belem Tower </b>- Important tip: be sure to purchase a combo ticket at the National Archeology museum which will grant you access to Belem Tower and Jerónimos Monastery.  You'll be able to skip the line at both attractions!  We only saw the outside of Belem Tower which seemed like enough.
</li>
<p>
<li> <b> Jerónimos Monastery </b> - Beautiful monastery located in the same part of town as Belem Tower.  Recommend going in the early morning or late evening to avoid crowds.  Pasteis de Belem is around the corner once you're done sightseeing for the day.
</li>
<p>
<li> <b>Pena Palace in Sintra </b> - We took <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Lisbon/Sintra-and-Cascais-Small-Group-Day-Trip-from-Lisbon/d538-5383SINTRACASCAIS" target="_blank">this tour</a> and really enjoyed it.  Sintra is a lengthy drive from Lisbon so highly recommend using a tour guide service since driving in Portugal can be a bit hectic.
  <p></ul>

  <h2><b> Where to stay</b> </h2>
  <ul><h3>
  <p>
  <li> <b> Madragoa neighborhood </b> - We stayed at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6276127" target="_blank">this Airbnb</a>
    which had beautiful terraces, but is a very small space.  Would not recommend for more than two people and requires climbing a steep staircase to reach the room. This neighborhood was quite sleepy, but conveniently located close enough to central areas that we could walk everywhere.
<p>
  <li><b> Bairro Alto</b> - This is arguably the most hip and lively neighborhood.  The streets come alive at night with small bars and the cute cable cars bustling up and down the streets.
