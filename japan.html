    <ul><h3></p>
      <p>
      <li>  <b> Gyoza at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298564-d7438346-Reviews-Chao_Chao_Sanjo_Kiyamachi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html" target="_blank">Chao Chao Sanjo Kiyamachi</a></b> -
      Put this on your bucket list of meals in life, it's that good.  A tiny restaurant with a few small tables and seating around the open kitchen makes for a fun and lively atmosphere.  Any of the gyoza will be incredible, but most importantly try the CHOCOLATE GYOZA for dessert.  They were so good we each had two orders.

    <p>
    <li>  <b> Ramen at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298564-d850055-Reviews-Kyoto_Gogyo-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html" target="_blank">Ramen Gogyo</a></b> - Small ramen restaurant hidden away, can often have a wait.  Try their burnt miso ramen for a salty, but delicious treat.

    <p>
      <li>  <b> Japanese BBQ at <a href="http://www.gyu-kaku.com/" target="_blank">Gyu-kaku</a></b> - Find out the difference between Japanese and Korean BBQ first head.  Be sure to order the yakishabu and toro beef.  Very different cuts of meat, but both are delicious.  Don't forget s'mores for dessert!
    </p></li>

    <p>
    <li>  <b> Anything at Nishiki Market</b> - Cute market located in central Kyoto downtown with many shops to choose from.  Be aware shops often close in the early evening so best to head in for lunch or an early dinner.
    </p></li>

    <h2><b> What to see</b> </h2>
    <ul><h3>
    <p>
    <li> <b> Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavillion) </b>- <i>Entry fee: ¥400.</i> Famous Zen temple located in Northern Kyoto which is worth a visit.  Can get very crowded with tourist groups during the day so recommend going at opening or closing.
    </li>

    <p>
    <li> <b> Fushimi Inari Taisha (Tori Gates) </b>- <i>Entry fee: ¥270. Located off the red Keihan line.</i> Very famous orange gates.  The most popular tourist location in Kyoto so make sure to agree upon a meeting place in case your group gets lost among the crowds traveling through the gates.
    </li>

    <p>
    <li> <b> Arashiyama Bamboo Forest </b>- Beautiful bamboo forest located in Arashiyama, a short distance outside of central Kyoto.  Would recommend taking an Uber to travel here since public transit is not convenient. You've likely seen photos popping up in your News Feed from friends or on Pinterest at this picture-worthy location!
    </li>

    <p>
    <li> <b> Arashiyama Monkey Park </b>- <i>Entry fee: ¥550 </i> Easy to pair with the Bamboo Forest for a half day trip. Bring small bills to buy fruit to feed the monkeys.  Make sure to visit during good weather and wear comfortable footwear since the park involves a short hike to reach the monkey station.
    </li>

    <h2><b> Where to stay</b> </h2>
    <ul><h3>

    <p>
    <li> <b> Goryocho </b> - We stayed at an Airbnb in this neighborhood (no longer listed on Airbnb website).  The Airbnb was located close to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and gardens - great for a morning run.  There were also several convenience stores and cute coffee shops nearby which gave the neighborhood a quaint feel.
    </li>

    <p>
    <li> <b> City Center </b> - Great location for shopping, nightlife and a variety of food. The shopping arcades along Kawaramachi and Shijo Street have a plethora of shopping and eating options including department store Tokyu Hands, clothings staples at Uniqlo and drug stores for all your Japanese beauty buys.
